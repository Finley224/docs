## Permissions

Permissions are implemented as bit maps. This means that they're stored as numbers, that should then be converted to binary. The indices where there is a binary `1` show that the permission at that index is given. In many languages, this can be consisely written as `(permissions & (1 << permission)) != 0`.

| Index | Number | Permission |
