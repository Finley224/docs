# Posting
:::note
This endpoint requires [authentication](/rest-api/intro/authentication).
:::

The endpoint for posting into home is `/home`, sending a POST request with this body:
```json
{
    "content": "Post content here"
}
```

For posting in livechat or group chats, you'll only need to change the endpoint to `/posts/livechat` or `/posts/CHAT_ID`, respectively.

In exchance, you'll get a [post object](/objects/post#examples) that looks like this:

```json
{
    "_id": "5c93e560-fddd-4146-98bc-edeb263d648f",
    "post_id": "5c93e560-fddd-4146-98bc-edeb263d648f",
    "post_origin": "home",
    "pinned": false,
    "type": 1,
    "t": {
        "d": "30",
        "mo": "01",
